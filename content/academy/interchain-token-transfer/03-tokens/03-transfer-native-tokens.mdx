In this exercise, you will learn how to transfer native tokens (AVAX) between accounts using Core Wallet. We'll demonstrate this using the Fuji testnet.

<Steps>
<Step>

## Open Core Wallet

First, make sure you have Core Wallet installed. If you don't have Core Wallet installed already, click the Download Core Wallet button below.

</Step>
<Step>

## Switch to Fuji Testnet

<ToolboxMdxWrapper enforceChainId={43113} />

</Step>
<Step>

## Get Test AVAX

Before transferring tokens, ensure you have some test AVAX:

Copy the coupon code:

```
avalanche-academy25
```

Now head to the [Avalanche Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c) and claim some AVAX tokens on the C-Chain of the Fuji testnet. Enter the coupon code in the according field.

</Step>
<Step>

## Transfer AVAX

To transfer AVAX to another address:

1. Click the "Send" button in Core Wallet
2. Enter the recipient's address
3. Enter the amount of AVAX to send
4. Review the transaction details
5. Click "Send" to confirm

If you encounter the following error:

```bash
error: a value is required for '--private-key <RAW_PRIVATE_KEY>' but none was supplied
```

This means the private key environment variable isn't set properly. You'll need to export your private key using the command below:
```bash
export PK=56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027
```

</Step>
<Step>

## Verify the Transfer

To verify the transfer was successful:

1. Check the transaction status in Core Wallet
2. View the transaction details on the [Fuji Explorer](https://testnet.snowtrace.io)
3. The recipient can check their balance in their Core Wallet

</Step>
</Steps>

<Callout>
Remember that you need to have enough AVAX in your wallet to cover both the transfer amount and the gas fees. Always double-check the recipient address before sending to avoid any loss of funds.

Now that you know how to transfer native tokens, you can proceed to learn about transferring ERC-20 tokens in the next section.
