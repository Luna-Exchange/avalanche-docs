## Validators in a Multi-Chain Network

Validators are nodes of a blockchain that secure the network by validating the transactions.
Each L1 in the Avalanche network has it's own set of validators that is running the `AvalancheGo` client.

All validators are registered on the P-Chain with a unique node ID, public key, and stake weight, mapped to the blockchain they are validating.

## Platform Chain (P-Chain)

The Platform Chain is the backbone for the native interoperability of the Avalanche network. It is a
registry of all validators in the Avalanche network. This includes the validators of the Primary
Network (including the X-, C- and P-Chain), as well as all L1s and legacy Subnet validators. The
following graphic shows a simplified data model of the P-Chain:

Builders can create new L1 blockchains in the Avalanche Network by issuing transactions on the
P-Chain. The P-Chain runs a special-purpose virtual machine called the
[platformvm](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego/tree/master/vms/platformvm). 

<Callout type="info">
**It is not EVM-based and therefore to interact with it you need a compatible wallet like Core wallet.**
</Callout> 

Creating new records for L1 blockchains on the P-Chain is done by issuing transactions like the `CreateSubnetTx`.

The P-Chain is secured by the Primary Network validators. L1 validators are syncing the P-Chain,
meaning they always have the latest view of the validator set of all blockchains in the Avalanche
network, but are not participating in the consensus of the P-Chain.

## Subnets/L1s vs Chains

It's important to understand that a **Subnet or L1** is a validator set, while a **chain** is an individual blockchain instance:

- **Subnet/L1**: A group of validators that can validate multiple blockchains
- **Chain**: A single blockchain validated by exactly one Subnet

While technically one Subnet can validate multiple chains (like the Primary Network validating P-Chain, C-Chain, and X-Chain), **in production it's almost always a 1:1 relationship**, and we strongly recommend keeping it as such for:
- **Simpler management**
- **Resource isolation**: Each application gets dedicated validator resources, and in the scenario that multiple validators go done, at least only one chain will be affected.  

## Subnets

Subnets are blockchains validated by a *subset of Primary Network validators*. 

Key technical characteristics:
- Validators must be Primary Network validators (2,000 AVAX stake requirement)
- Validators sync and validate the entire Primary Network (X, P, C chains) - takes longer to sync
- Validator set is constrained to existing Primary Network participants

Architecture" />

## L1s

L1s are blockchains with *sovereign validator sets* independent of the Primary Network.

Key technical characteristics:
- Validators form their own independent validator set
- Validators pay continuous fees (~1.33 AVAX/month)
- Validators only sync the P-Chain, not the entire Primary Network (faster synce time)
- No dependency on Primary Network validator participation

In the [Subnet Creation](/academy/permissioned-l1s/01-introduction/03-create-subnet.mdx) section we will cover how to create an Subnet using [Avalanche's Toolbox](https://build.avax.network/tools/l1-toolbox).
